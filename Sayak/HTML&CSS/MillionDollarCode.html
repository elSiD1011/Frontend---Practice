    <h2>Sid's Story - The Dream</h2>
    <p>Sid’s fascination with speed began the day his father handed him a rusty
      carburetor from an old sedan. He was only eight, but the intricate mesh
      of metal, valves, and pistons ignited a curiosity that would shape his
      life forever. While other kids played video games, Sid spent his days
      dismantling his father's spare parts—gearboxes, camshafts, and
      differential assemblies—attempting to decode the language of
      machinery.<br /><br />
      By the time he turned twelve, Sid had transformed the family garage into
      a mini engineering lab. Using discarded parts, he pieced together his
      first working prototype: a rudimentary go-kart powered by a salvaged
      internal combustion engine. Though crude, it marked the beginning of his
      dream to one day master the engineering marvels of F1 cars—machines that
      could generate over 1,000 horsepower and endure forces of up to 6g in
      high-speed corners.<br /><br />
      Sid’s idols weren’t just drivers but also engineers like Adrian Newey,
      the mastermind behind some of the fastest F1 cars. For him, the dream
      was never just about racing—it was about understanding the aerodynamics,
      telemetry, and precision engineering that made F1 a pinnacle of
      innovation.<br /><br />
      As he tightened the final bolt on his latest creation, Sid whispered to
      himself, One day, I’ll make my mark in <span style="color: red;">Formula One</span>. I'll build the most advaced
      racecar of my time!<br />

      <h2>Sid's Story - The Truth</h2>
      <p>
        As Siddharth grew older, his obsession with speed and precision only deepened. By sixteen, he had already built
        a fully functional single-seater using a modified motorcycle engine. The kart wasn't just fast—it handled like a
        dream, thanks to the custom suspension he designed using knowledge he had picked up from F1 engineering manuals.
        While other teenagers were preparing for college, Siddharth was analysing telemetry data, adjusting gear ratios,
        and fine-tuning his vehicle’s aerodynamics. But talent alone wasn’t enough. The world of Formula 1 was
        ruthless—an industry where young drivers needed deep pockets or sponsors willing to invest in their future.
        Siddharth had neither. His family, though supportive, couldn’t afford the millions required to fund a
        professional racing career. The dream seemed impossible.<br><br>
        Still, he refused to give up. If he couldn’t buy his way into F1, he would engineer his way in. He took on odd
        jobs at local garages, learning the nuances of high-performance tuning. He devoured books on CFD (Computational
        Fluid Dynamics), engine mapping, and drag reduction systems. At night, he worked on simulations, fine-tuning
        virtual cars on racing software used by real F1 teams.<br><br>
        Then, fate intervened. A former motorsport engineer, impressed by Siddharth’s self-taught brilliance, offered
        him a shot—a chance to join a junior racing program. It was an opportunity to finally get behind the wheel of a
        real race car, to prove that he wasn’t just a mechanic or a dreamer but a racer destined for the grandest stage
        of them all.<br><br>
        With his heart pounding, Siddharth knew—this was the moment he had been waiting for.
