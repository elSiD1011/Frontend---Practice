      <h3 style="text-align: center">What Is A Formula 1 Racing Event?</h3>
      <p>
        Formula 1 (also Formula One or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One
        World Championship) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing.
        An F1 season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (from
        French, meaning grand prizes), held worldwide on purpose-built F1
        circuits and sometimes public roads. Formula 1 cars are among the
        fastest road course racing cars in the world. <br />
        <br />
        With the very first Formula 1 World Championship Grand Prix taking place
        on May 13, 1950 at Silverstone, England, Formula 1 was considered
        without doubt one of the world’s most dangerous and exciting forms of
        sport. Its golden age, the 60s and 70s, was also its deadliest; when
        drivers lost their lives at frightening rates. Considered the golden age
        because of the powerful cars, charismatic drivers, and thrilling races,
        the 1970s saw the rise of 3.5-liter V8 engines, such as the Cosworth DFV
        and Ferrari 015 flat 12 which is technically considered a V12. There was
        no safety culture back in the 1950s. Following World War II, people were
        accustomed to the possibility of death and considered it to be quite
        normal. It was incredibly risky to be a professional racer. Not even
        seatbelts were required until 1972. The sport, according to many
        legendary racers was the ultimate in sex appeal and hence they took
        part.<br />

        I just have to mention an extract from an article I read on F1 by the
        Scuderia Ferrari Club. It goes as this: ‘Are the vehicles of today’s
        Formula 1 cool? Well, their exotic materials and state-of-the-art
        technology may be nice, but how many people dream of an F1 car when they
        see one today? In my experience, not many. Regardless of age, I believe
        the majority of people will concur that the Formula 1 vehicles of the
        1960s, 1970s, and 1980s had a personality that modern machines simply
        lack.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to being more mechanical and raw than today’s computer-laden
        F1 cars, the classic cars of the past also had unique styles and
        personalities that made them stand out on the grid. Even younger folks
        who were born long after Formula One’s “glory” years still enjoy the
        classics for a reason. It goes beyond nostalgia.’<br />
        <br />
        
        <p style="text-align: center"><b>Did you know: The top speed of the first generation Formula 1 cars
          was around 180 miles per hour (289 kph), while the top speed of modern
          F1 cars can exceed 230 mph (370 kph)!</b>
