      // Variables are what make up most of JavaScript. These variables make up things from numbers to objects, which are all over JavaScript to make one's life much easier.

      // in short, variables are containers for storing data values.
      // In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare a variable: var, let, and const.

      // var: The var keyword is used to declare a variable that can be re-assigned. It is function-scoped or globally scoped. In short var is used to declare a variable that can be changed later and can be accessed outside the block.
      var name = "Sayak";
      var name = "Siddharth"; // re-declaring the variable
      console.log(name); // Output: Sayak

      // let: The let keyword is used to declare a variable that can be re-assigned. It is block-scoped. In short let is used to declare a variable that can be changed later but not outside the block.
      let age = 25;
      console.log(age); // Output: 25   

      // const: The const keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be re-assigned. It is block-scoped. In short const is used to declare a variable that cannot be changed later and can be accessed outside the block.
      const country = "India";
      console.log(country); // Output: India

      // Note: Variables declared with const must be initialized at the time of declaration. If you try to declare a variable with const without initializing it, you will get an error.

      // Using a Variable
      var number1 = 5;
      number1 = 3;
    // Here, we defined a number called "number1" which was equal to 5. However, on the second line, we changed the value to 3.

    let number2 = 10;
    number2 = 20;
    // Here, we defined a number called "number2" which was equal to 10. However, on the second line, we changed the value to 20.

    const number3 = 15;
    console.log("ðŸš€ ~ number3:", number3)
    // number3 = 25; // This will throw an error because we cannot change the value of a constant variable.

    console.log(number1 + number2 + number3);

    // We can also add strings which will concatenate them, or put them together. For example:
    var myString = "My Name is" + " Siddhart"; // "I am a string!"
    console.log("ðŸš€ ~ myString:", myString);

    // Types of Variables
    var myInteger = 12; // 32-bit number (from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
    var myLong = 9310141419482; // 64-bit number (from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
    var myFloat = 5.5; // 32-bit floating-point number (decimal)
    var myDouble = 9310141419482.22; // 64-bit floating-point number
    var myBoolean = true; // 1-bit true/false (0 or 1)
    var myBoolean2 = false;
    var myNotANumber = NaN;
    var NaN_Example = 0/0; // NaN: Division by Zero is not possible
    var notDefined; // undefined: we didn't define it to anything yet
    window.alert(aRandomVariable); // undefined
    var myNull = null; // null

    // The difference between undefined and null is that undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, while null is an assignment value that represents no value. In other words, undefined is a type itself, while null is an object.
